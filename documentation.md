_______________________________
**:LORE:**

Originally this project had to be a solution of the school task,
but during the problem solving _*(It should be system which can
create, update, search and delete requests with the list of
variables [id, Name, Surname, Job, Salary] like in databases so
because of it I've named this project like **databaseimitating**)*_
I was expanding the functionality of the **databaseimitating** class
until it looked more like a notepad program class. Regardless it's possible to
use my program like a very basic notepad utility.
